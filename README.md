# Peruvian Agriculture Factors
## Sources and analysis of data

The objective of this thesis is to study the prices of the white potato farm using factors related to market access in Peru.

This is the repository where my methodology for the reproducibility of obtaining the data I used for the model is located, based on the [2017 National Agricultural Survey of Peru (ENA)](https://webinei.inei.gob.pe/anda_inei/index.php/catalog/654/data_dictionary) and the [2016 National Census of Mercado de Abastos in Peru (CENAMA)](https://webinei.inei.gob.pe/anda_inei/index.php/catalog/576/data_dictionary). In addition, some scripts were generated in Python to generate the distance data.
